-- The currentUser() helper will return the Backend User object of the currently active user, which includes helpful information like the user's name or email address. It does count towards the Backend API request rate limit so it's recommended to use the useUser() hook on the client side when possible and only use currentUser() when you specifically need user data in a server context. For more information on this helper, see the currentUser() reference.
